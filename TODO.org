* Host addition
** Should be done asynchronously,
   Host resolution must be done immediately,
   the rest must be async, done between send+receive
   sequences (after previous recv and before next send)
** To help accomplish this, we might need to
   set a flag that stops execution after all replies are
   received or timeouts have expired. This way the
   context will return by itself.
*** How do we tell when the context returns by itself?
    and when all the handlers are done?
** Rewrite the test for the new setting.
** Timer pointer must be shared ptr preventing accidental destruciton
** all functions (send, timeout, etc) in pinger must be done per host
   NOT for all hosts
** Cancel timer before deleting
