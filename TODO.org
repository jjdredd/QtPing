* Host addition
** Should be done asynchronously,
   Host resolution must be done immediately,
   the rest must be async, done between send+receive
   sequences (after previous recv and before next send)
** To help accomplish this, we might need to
   set a flag that stops execution after all replies are
   received or timeouts have expired. This way the
   context will return by itself.
** Rewrite the test for the new setting.
